I was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, an ancient city in east China. Currently I am a senior in School of Aerospace Engineering in Tsinghua University, and having an online internship at CITA. I'm interested in a variety of topics, including dark matter, large-scale structure and galatic dynamics. I'm the author and maintainer of {{< staticref "https://github.com/Zangshihui/TideRec" "newtab" >}}TideRec{{< /staticref >}} package, providing python version of tidal reconstruction in {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01575" "newtab" >}}Zhu et al. 2021{{< /staticref >}}.
