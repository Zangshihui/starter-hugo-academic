title: Measure cosmic tides with DES Y1 data
summary: We performed 2-shear-term and 5-shear-term tidal reconstruction in red shift space with six independent catalogs produced by N-body simulation and soft mass cut. The cross correlation coefficient, propagator and noise power are used to quantify the results of two tidal reconstruction algorithms in red shift space.
