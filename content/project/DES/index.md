title: Measure cosmic tides with DES Y1 data
summary: We proposed the planar tidal reconstruction methodology to deal with projected density field in order to get rid of errors induced by photo-Z errors and redshift distortions. This method is applied to the RedMagic catalog of DES Y1 data. We perform tidal reconstruction on corresponding area. Now we are trying to improve cosmological constraints based on this result.
