title: Measure cosmic tides with DES Y1 data
summary: We proposed the planar tidal reconstruction methodology to deal with projected density field in order to get rid of errors induced by photo-Z errors and redshift distortions. This method is applied to the RedMagic catalog of DES Y1 data. We perform tidal reconstruction on corresponding area. Now we are trying to improve cosmological constraints based on this result.

 Since photo-Z error and redshift distortions bring about unnegligible error along line-of-sight, resulting in loss of most information in that direction, we projected halo catalogs onto a plane. In this project, we proposed the planar tidal reconstruction methodology to deal with projected density field. Currently we have applied this methodology on RedMegic catalog of {{< staticref "https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/y1a1/key-catalogs" "newtab" >}}DES Y1{{< /staticref >}} data and obtained the correspoinding density field.

 Next we will calculate the power spectrum and improve cosmology constraints according to this result.
