title: Cosmic tidal reconstruction in redshift space
summary: We performed 2-shear-term and 5-shear-term tidal reconstruction in red shift space with six independent catalogs produced by N-body simulation and soft mass cut. The cross correlation coefficient, propagator and noise power are used to quantify the results of two tidal reconstruction algorithms in red shift space.

 The project discusses tidal reconstruction in redshift space by using cross correlation coefficient, propagator and noise power to quantify tidal reconstruction with redshift-space distortion. We compare both 2-shear-term tidal reconstruction and 5-shear-term tidal reconstruction to show their robustness in redshift space.

The RSD effect brings about anisotropy in 5-shear-term tidal reconstruction. The RSD effect is a second-order effect in 2-shear-term tidal reconstruction for that two shear terms are not sensitive to errors along line-of-sight. Although 5-shear-term tidal reconstruction is likely to suffer from the RSD effect, this algorithm still performs slightly better than 2-shear-term tidal reconstruction in redshift-space, recovering more modes.

We also acquire large-scale linear bias from tidal reconstruction in redshift-space. The bias is constant in each bin with good approximation, which can be well fitted into a quadratic polynomial. However, more detailed studies are required to explain the relation behind anisotropic bias and peculiar velocity.
